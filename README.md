# BG3 Drakewarden
Mod implementing Drakewarden in Baldur's Gate 3

To better fit BG3, we made some changed, listed below.

- Drake Companion: there is no model for "wingless" dragon, so we used the winged one (but we managed to make it in different colors). However, we managed to add walking/flying animation, which was pretty hard and this is currently the first mod achieving that using vanilla animations. NB: as per Larian's pet design it can act with its own action resources and grows up in steps instead of dynamically with your level (and we also increased its stats compared to the manual). Basically works like the Beast Master's pet but also grows in size at higher levels. A change we decided to made is to make the dragon go large from level 11 instead of 15, since the vanilla game ends at 12 and we didn't want to force players to unlock the level curve to 20 to enjoy this aspect of the class. The level 15 one is even bigger. 
- Drake's Breath: this was made pretty accurate when used by the Ranger, but the version used by the Drake had to be changed to a projectile (with AOE) instead of a cone attack. This is because the cone animation is currently broken on Dragon model, but it's not a great loss because the projectile skills are spectacular. 
- Mounting: completely removed, like with all the other summons in BG3. To compensate for this, we added 2 new attacks unlocked at high levels (a fly+slam that pushes away opponents and a melee slam AOE).
- Limited uses per day based on stats: changed to unlimited or once per short rest, like many other BG3 skills.

- Draconic Gifts: added 3 draconic gifts as items that unlock skills. Check the NexusMods description.
