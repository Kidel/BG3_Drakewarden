# BG3Drakewarden
Mod implementing Drakewarden in Baldur's Gate 3

To better fit BG3, we made some changed, listed below.

- Drake Companion: there is no model for "wingless" dragon, so we used the winged one. Also only in red. However, we managed to add walking/flying animation, which was pretty hard and this is currently the first mod achieving that using vanilla animations. NB: as per Larian's pet design it can act with its own action resources and grows up in steps instead of dynamically with your level. Basically works like the Beast Master's pet but also grows in size at higher levels. 
- Drake's Breath: this was made pretty accurate when used by the Ranger, but the version used by the Drake had to be changed to a projectile (with AOE) instead of a cone attack. This is because the cone animation is currently broken on Dragon model, but it's not a great loss because the projectile skills are spectacular. 
- Mounting: completely removed, like with all the other summons in BG3. To compensate for this, we added 2 new attacks unlocked at high levels (a fly+slam that pushes away opponents and a melee slam AOE).
